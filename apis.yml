      This is the OpenAPI specification for the [Figma REST
      API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api).


      Note: we are releasing the OpenAPI specification as a beta given the large
      surface area and complexity of the REST API. If you notice any
      inaccuracies with the specification, please [file an
      issue](https://github.com/figma/rest-api-spec/issues).
